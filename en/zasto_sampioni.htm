            <p class="ContentSubTitle">What is &quot;championism&quot;?</p>
            <p>&quot;<b>Championism</b>&quot; is the common name that we use to 
            describe person characteristics such as: stupidity, ignorance, 
            egoism and 
            lack of competence. It is a virus that infected not just IT sector, 
            but almost every aspect of today&#39;s business. People who carry and 
            spread that virus are called &quot;champions&quot; or &quot;World-class champions&quot;. 
            If you&#39;ve been to similar sites on the Internet, you probably found more 
            popular terms such as &quot;cowboy manager&quot; or &quot;hero programmer&quot;, but it 
            is basically the same. A Moron is a moron. Period.</p>
            <p><b>Remark for non-Croatian readers</b>: The authors of this site 
            are Croatians and the word &quot;champions&quot;&nbsp; is spelled sampioni 
            in Croatian language. This is the reason why the site is located at sampioni.com.</p>
            <p class="ContentSubTitle">Why &quot;champion&quot;? Why not just call them 
            idiots?</p>
            <p>The term <b>champions</b> was introduced in a small Croatian 
            software firm where authors of this site worked for one miserable 
            period of their life and that inspired the creation of this site. 
            The firm is thoroughly described in our central story,
            <a href="Legenda.htm">The Legend of champions</a>. If you are too 
            eager to find out why we use the term champion, let&#39;s just say that 
            owner of that firm referred to his staff as &quot;world-class champions&quot;, 
            although many of them were totally incompetent and deserved a totally 
            different name. So, the term &quot;champions&quot; carries a big dose of 
            irony.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p class="ContentSubTitle">You still don&#39;t get it?</p>
            <p>We suggest that you dig into <a href="Sampionski_manifest.htm">
            Champion&#39;s manifest</a> and <a href="Legenda.htm">The Legend of 
            champions.</a> All answers are there.</p>
            <p class="ContentSubTitle">What is the a &quot;champ&quot; firm?</p>
            <p>A &quot;champ&quot; firm is company whose management is dominated by 
            champions. The main concern of champ managers is how to hide their 
            inefficiencies and incompetence. Instead of being dedicated to 
            business issues, quality assurance, learning new technologies, 
            self-improvement and similar &quot;non-champion&quot; activities, they spend 
            all their energy in political games, manipulation, sucking up to 
            higher authorities and stabbing each other&#39;s back. 
              </p>
            <p>Champ firms follow the <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/">Dilbert&#39;s</a> 
            principle that says that the easiest way to remove the idiot from 
            every day&#39;s business is to promote him to a manager&#39;s position. Some 
            pessimists believe that most of the firms really work by that 
            principle, but let&#39;s be idealists and believe that it isn&#39;t so until 
            proved differently.</p>
            <p class="ContentSubTitle">Who are authors of this site?</p>
            <p class="content">Authors of this site are two idealistic 
            programmers who enjoy their work, especially if it&#39;s done 
            professionally and who disgust stupidity, incompetence and politics. 
            Unfortunately, one period of their life they had to work with 
            genuine champions and tolerate their ignorance. That experience was 
            so painful that they decided it shouldn&#39;t be kept in their 
            fragile memory, but rather shared with other people who can learn 
            from their experience and try to avoid champions in their lives.</p>
            <p class="content">We won&#39;t tell you our real names. Although we 
            quit our champ firm long time ago, we are well-aware that champions, 
            as our slogan says, are everywhere , even in our current company. We 
            feel that it is better to stay anonymous for the moment.</p>
            <p class="ContentSubTitle">Inspiration</p>
            <p class="content">The idea of writing about bad firms and bad 
            managers didn&#39;t come just from our experience. The big thanks goes 
            to great site we accidentally came across,&nbsp;
            <a href="http://www.softwarereality.com/">www.softwarereality.com</a>. 
            There you can find true stories about software firms, lousy 
            managers, stinky colleagues and other characters you meet in your 
            every day&#39;s life. We definitely recommend that you visit that site.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="ContentSubTitle">Before you continue..</p>
            <p>Just be warned that, although the purpose of this site is fun, 
            you maybe won&#39;t laugh if you find out that you are really a true 
            &quot;world-class&quot; champion and that you are proud of that. If that is 
            the case, we suggest that you find some other site that doesn&#39;t make 
            fun of champions and that glorifies stupidity and ignorance. We 
            haven&#39;t found it yet, but if you do succeed, please let us know. :))</p>
